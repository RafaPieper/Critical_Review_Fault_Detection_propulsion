# Critical Review: Fault Detection in USV Propellers Using Wavelet Transforms on Vibration Signals

***Abstract*** â€” This critical review evaluates the study by Cho et al., which proposes a system for fault detection and classification in USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) propellers using vibration analysis through Continuous Wavelet Transform within a Visual Transformer (ViT) algorithm. The relevance of the article lies in the importance of monitoring and mitigating faults and operational risks at sea. The technical analysis highlights the simulation of fault scenarios and the model's accuracy; however, methodological gaps were identified that warrant attention in future research. Despite these considerations, the study reinforces the potential of integrating advanced signal analysis and machine learning for predictive maintenance monitoring. A real-life case involving cables in the propeller illustrates the practical applicability of the technology. It is concluded that, although promising, the work of Cho et al. underscores the need for greater methodological rigor to ensure reproducibility and the practical implementation of such innovations.
